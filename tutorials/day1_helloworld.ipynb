In this you have analogs to the workspace and when you type code into the terminal, it is executed and the memory of the current session is kept. Kernels (Ipykernels and jupyter notebooks) are somewhat related to this in that it provides a souped-up interactive mode where the current working memory is shared between cells but restarting the kernel has similar implications to clearing your workspace.\n",
